Changes:

  - Version 1.3 has been rewritten to use objects - see the manpage.

Description:

  - This module requires input of the shipping method, origin zip code, 
    destination zip code, and weight of the package.
  - It then connects to the UPS calculation server and outputs the total
    shipping charges and the UPS zone. 

  It is a very simplified way of finding shipping costs based on the "Quick
  Cost Calculator" document found on the UPS Website at
    http://www.ups.com/tools/tools.html
