Business::UPSShipping - UPS Shipping Cost Module v1.0

Feed this module four things (shipping method, from zip, 'to' zip, and
weight) and it gives you the cost to ship it, and the UPS zone.

This module sends an http request to a CGI at UPS which gives the actual
information.

It is a very simplified way of finding shipping costs based on the "Quick
Cost Calculator" document found on the UPS Website at
http://www.ups.com/tools/tools.html
